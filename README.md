# React Router Playground

This project acts as a playground (testing area) to test how React Router v6 works.

React Router is the most popular 3rd-party library for handling client-side routing. At its core, it’s a library built for conditionally rendering certain “pages” depending on the current URL route of the app.

React Router is the primary way most applications handle client-side routing, which allows React developers to create “single-page” web apps.
